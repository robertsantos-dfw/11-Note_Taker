## Description 

It's very important when working on a project to take notes. But it is impossible to keep up with your notes so we've built an app that will store your notes, but also delete and edit the notes to keep them updated as you make progress.

## Installation

This application will be located on HEROKU. Please follow the link to visit the app.



## Usage 

This application is simple, clean, easy to use and undertand. You will be able to create new notes once you've passed the "Get Started" page. This will take you to the notes page where you can Create, Edit, and Delete notes. You may have to refresh to see the new changes, but it will work.
